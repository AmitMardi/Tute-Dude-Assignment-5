# Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks

This Python program stores student names and their marks in a dictionary.  
It allows the user to enter a student's name and displays their marks if found.

## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. Enter the student's name when prompted. (student's name: Alice, Mike,Nike)
3. The program will:
   - Display the student's marks if the name exists in the dictionary.
   - Show "student not found" if the name does not exist.

**Note:**  
- The program uses `capitalize()` to ensure the first letter is uppercase for matching.


# Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing

This Python program demonstrates list slicing and reversing operations.

## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. The program will:
   - Display the original list.
   - Extract and display the first five elements of the list.
   - Reverse and display the extracted elements.

**Note:**  
- Slicing `[:5]` extracts elements from index 0 to 4.  
- The `.reverse()` method reverses the elements in place.
